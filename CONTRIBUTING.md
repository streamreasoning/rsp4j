## Getting Started

RSP4J's [open issues are here](https://github.com/streamreasoning/rsp4j/issues). 
An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the RSP4J issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated.

## Contributions

RSP4J welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to RSP4J should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Fork the RSP4J project and create a new branch, push your changes and create a pull request. Make sure the project compiles and passes all tests.
  More information on create pull request can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). 

- Write documentation describing the functionality of new classes, interfaces or methods that do not inherit their functionality.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
